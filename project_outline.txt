1. Business Understanding
Who are the stakeholders?
Microsoft executives.

Goals?
Looking to us to come up with recommendations as to what movies they should be making.
   ** Are they looking for high grossing movies, genres
   ** Award winning type movies
   ** Big actors/actresses, screenwriters, directors, etc. 
    
   ** Correlation on budget vs box office? Return on their investment?
    How well do indie movies that show at Cannes and Festivals, how well they do at box offices.
    How much do movies make on dvd sales, licensing, streaming.

What characters and franchises do they own that they could make movies from.
    - Case study ex. how well do video game movies do. checking out how well those types of movies do.

2. Prepare Data
What data do we need?
