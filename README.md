### To Preface, a Note About Data Collection

In the data api notebook you will notice that our team wrote a program that takes data directly from 'The Movie Database' API. While you are more than welcome to run that query and get the most up-to-date data, be wary that the query will take between two and three hours to run.


Yeah, but your (data) scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

## Abstract



## Business Problem





## Data Description

Copies of the data we used and how we prepared it for analysis are included in this repository. We have sourced our data primarily from 'Rotten Tomatoes,' 'IMDB,' and 'The Movie Database'

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, including description of trends over time. This provides a useful overview of AAC's typical intakes and outcomes to identify resource needs.

## Results



## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for a succesful foray into the realm of movie magic:

- **Uno
- **Numba Two
- **San

### Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights to further improve operations at AAC:

- **Potential release dates for increased revenue
- **Advertising/Marketing ROI effets
- **
