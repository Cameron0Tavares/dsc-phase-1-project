### To Preface, a Note About Data Collection

In the data api notebook you will notice that our team wrote a program that takes data directly from 'The Movie Database' API.
While you are more than welcom to run that query and get the most up-to-date data, be wary that the query will take between two and three hours to run.


### Abstract

### Data Description
Copies of the data we used and how we prepared it for analysis are included in this repository.
We have sourced our data primarily from 'Rotten Tomatoes,' 'IMDB,' and 'The Movie Database'


### Methodology
Yeah, but your (data) scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
